A short obstacle racer demo for the low power PlayDate console

The PlayDate is a retro-style system with a 168 MHz CPU and no game engines -- all game logic is handled through a simple loop.
This demo is built to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the PlayDate, including a custom implementation of realistic velocity, acceleration, and movement physics that can support everything from a racer to a platformer to a top down adventure.
